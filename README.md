Description

The goal of this project is to perform data cleaning, exploration, and analysis using NumPy & Pandas.

🎯 Objectives

Understand the dataset structure.

Perform cleaning and preprocessing (handle missing values, extract useful features like year_added).

Explore insights such as:

Number of movies vs TV shows.

Content distribution by country.

Most common ratings.

Trend of content added over years.

Apply pandas functions like value_counts(), groupby(), sort_values(), sort_index() etc.
